@EPFL - CS-108

Project for the CS-108 course at EPFL. The project consisted of developing a Java application for visualizing stars and other celestial bodies.
This is made thanks to the implementation of a graphical user interface (GUI) for an interactive user experience and mathematical modelling to accurately depict the positions of astral objects in the sky.
